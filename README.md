This project is from Niclas Mummert, student of the DHBW Stuttgart and Bertrandt Technologie Gmbh. It contains the outcome of the Studienarbeit: "Kontinuierliche Evaluierung von KI-basierten interaktiven Systemen", which is about dynamically adapt an UI-button by using two AI systems. The first analyses the surfacetype (tarmac, stone path and dirt road) and the second decides with the outcome of the first AI which suspensiotype (Normal, Comfort, Sport, Sport+) will be suggest for the User. While the AI for anaylsing the surfacetype of the street will be used within the Microsoft Azure Cloud and will not be changed, the first 15 driving situations will be interpreted by an pretrained knn-model. After 15 driving situations the knn-model will be changed to a new knn-model trained with the last 15 decisions of the user. 
After 35 driving situations are completed by the user, the user have to evaluate the functionality, suitability and the complexity of the system. The answers will be written into a Excel spread sheet and will be anaylsed. 
Furthermore linting tests, unittest and code coverage tests secure the right behavior off the UI and the AI systems. The test will be automatically invoked by an Azure DevOps Pipeline every sunday or by new commits of the current github repo. Both unittest and code coverage tests will be reported to the DevOps Pipeline
